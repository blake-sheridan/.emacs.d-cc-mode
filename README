INTRODUCTION

    Please read the cc-mode.texi manual for details on using CC Mode.

    As of this writing (03-Feb-1998), CC Mode version 5 currently
    works out of the box with XEmacs 19.15, 19.16, XEmacs 20.3, and
    Emacs 20.2.  CC Mode will be distributed with the next version of
    Emacs and XEmacs.  See the "COMPATIBILITY" section below for
    details.

MORE INFORMATION

    NOTE: Since there are now multiple maintainers of CC Mode, you
    MUST address all correspondence to cc-mode-help@python.org.

    The canonical Web site for CC Mode is

	<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/>

    and the CC Mode detailed release notes page is

	<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/cc-details.html>

    Check these for the latest information, updates, tips, etc. on
    using CC Mode 5.

    The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you
    should have gotten with this distribution.

MANUALS

    Preformatted versions of the manual in DVI, PostScript, and Info,
    are all available at the CC Mode Web page.

    To build the manual yourself, you will need the latest Texinfo
    release (as of this writing, Texinfo 3.9).  Specifically, you must
    make sure that your are using at least version 2.185 of the
    texinfo.tex file.  To build the Info manual, simply type:

        % makeinfo cc-mode.texi

    To make the DVI version, simply type:

        % texi2dvi cc-mode.texi

    Note that I've heard of other package releases that purport to
    include a texinfo.tex file newer than 2.185, but these don't
    support the @macro{} command.  If you have problems building the
    manuals, pick up a pre-built version.

COMPATIBILITY

    1. XEmacs
    
    If you are using XEmacs 19.15, 19.16 or any XEmacs 20 version, you
    should be able to use this new version right out of the box. This
    stuff unpacks in its own subdirectory now and contains a number of
    files. Just make sure this subdirectory is on your load-path
    before the XEmacs distribution's lisp directories. You need to
    byte compile all the .el files by doing the following:

        % cd /path/to/cc-mode
        % xemacs -batch -no-site-file -q -l cc-make.el cc-*.el

    You'll get a lot of warnings, BUT YOU CAN SAFELY IGNORE THEM.

    To test, visit a C file and then type:

        M-x c-version RET
        ==> Using CC Mode version 5.XX

    where XX is the current minor release number.

    I have no idea whether CC Mode 5 will work with XEmacs 19.14 or
    earlier. You might try following the directions for Emacs 19.34
    below (although you will not need the cc-mode-19.el file).  There
    is no plan to actively support any earlier XEmacs versions.


    2. Emacs 20

    You should be able to use this version right out of the box. You
    can basically follow the directions for XEmacs above (substituting
    `emacs' for `xemacs' in the byte compilation step, of course!)


    3. Emacs 19.34

    Emacs 19.34 is missing some stuff that CC Mode requires, but you
    can make CC Mode 5 work with it by doing the following:

    - You must first download Per Abraham's Custom library from this
      location: <http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>.  Follow the 
      installation instructions in that package.  There may be
      compatibility issues with the new Custom library.  See the CC
      Mode details page for more information.

    - You must arrange for Custom to be loaded both when you byte
      compile CC Mode, and when you run Emacs.  To do this during the
      byte compilation phase, edit the cc-make.el file (as directed in
      that file's comments) to contain the path to the Custom library.

    - Now byte compile the CC Mode source as described in the XEmacs
      section above (substituting `emacs' for `xemacs' in the byte
      compilation step, of course!).

    - You must edit your .emacs file so that the path to the Custom
      library is prepended to your load-path.  Here's some sample
      code:

      (setq load-path (cons "/path/to/custom" load-path))

    I have no idea whether CC Mode 5 will work with Emacs versions
    before 19.34.  There are no plans to actively support any earlier
    Emacs versions.


    4. delbackspace.el and awk-mode

    There are some known compatibility problems with these packages.
    See the CC Mode detailed release notes Web page for workarounds.
