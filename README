README for CC Mode 5.12
Barry A. Warsaw <cc-mode-help@python.org>

INTRODUCTION

    Please read the cc-mode.texi manual for details on using CC Mode.

    As of this writing (08-Jul-1997), CC Mode version 5 currently
    works out of the box only with XEmacs 19.15 and XEmacs 20.0, and
    will work with the next version of Emacs.  CC Mode will be
    distributed with the next version of Emacs and XEmacs.

    Emacs 19.34 is missing some stuff that CC Mode requires, but you
    can make CC Mode 5 work with it by loading the file cc-mode-19.el.
    See that file for details.

BYTE COMPILING

    You must byte compile the CC Mode .el files.  First, cd to the
    directory you unpacked the files in.  For XEmacs 19.15, XEmacs
    20.2 and Emacs 19.34, this can be any directory on your
    load-path.  For Emacs 20 it must be $EMACSDIR/lisp/progmodes and
    for XEmacs 20.3 it must be $EMACSDIR/lisp/cc-mode.

    Then, run the following at your shell prompt:

    % $EMACS -batch -no-site-file -q -l cc-make.el cc-*.el

MORE INFORMATION

    Check the CC Mode web pages

	<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/cc-details.html>

    for more information.

    The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you
    should have gotten with this distribution.

MANUALS

    Preformatted versions of the manual in DVI, PostScript, and Info,
    are all available at <http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/>.

    To build the manual yourself, you will need the latest Texinfo
    release (currently Texinfo 3.9).  Specifically, you must make sure
    that your are using at least version 2.185 of the texinfo.tex
    file.  To build the Info manual, simply type:

        % makeinfo cc-mode.texi

    To make the DVI version, simply type:

        % texi2dvi cc-mode.texi
