INTRODUCTION

    Please read the cc-mode.texi manual for details on using CC Mode.

    As of this writing (31-Aug-1998), CC Mode version 5 currently
    works out of the box with XEmacs versions 19.15, 19.16, 20.3,
    20.4, and 21.0, and with Emacs versions 19.34, 20.2, 20.3.

MORE INFORMATION

    NOTE: Since there are now multiple maintainers of CC Mode, you
    MUST address all correspondence to bug-cc-mode@gnu.org (or
    cc-mode-help@python.org, is address is being phased out).

    The canonical Web site for CC Mode is

	<http://www.python.org/emacs/cc-mode/>

    Check this for the latest information, updates, tips, installation
    and compatibility notes, etc. on using CC Mode 5.

    The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you
    should have gotten with this distribution.

MANUALS

    Preformatted versions of the manual in DVI, PostScript, and Info,
    are all available at the CC Mode Web page.

    To build the manual yourself, you will need the latest Texinfo
    release (as of this writing, Texinfo 3.11).  Specifically, you
    must make sure that your are using at least version 2.185 of the
    texinfo.tex file.  To build the Info manual, simply type:

        % makeinfo cc-mode.texi

    To make the DVI version, simply type:

        % texi2dvi cc-mode.texi

    Note that I've heard of other package releases that purport to
    include a texinfo.tex file newer than 2.185, but these don't
    support the @macro{} command.  If you have problems building the
    manuals, pick up a pre-built version.
