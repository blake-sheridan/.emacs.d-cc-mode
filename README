Note, you can browse this file either as a flat, multiple page file,
or as an Emacs outline.  As a flat file, just use "C-x ]" to move
forward one page, or "C-x [" to move backward one page.  To read this
as an outline, hit "M-x outline-mode RET".  outline-mode is described
in your Emacs documentation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The meat of this document is now encapsulated in a
texinfo file.  This file contains only change information.  Huge
thanks go to Krishna Padmasola <krishna@earth-gw.njit.edu> for his
conversion of the README to texinfo.

* User visible changes since 4.35

** c-set-offset and related functions and variables can now accept
   variable symbols.  Also ++ and -- which mean 2* positive and
   negative c-basic-offset respectively.

** new variable, c-recognize-knr-p, which controls whether K&R C
   contructs will be recognized.  Trying to recognize K&R constructs
   is a time hog so if you're programming strictly in ANSI C, set this
   variable to nil (it should already be nil in c++-mode).

** new variable, c-hanging-comment-ender-p for controlling
   c-fill-paragraph's behavior.

** new syntactic symbol: statement-case-open.  This is assigned to
   lines containing an open brace just after a case/default label.

** new variable, c-progress-interval, which controls minibuffer update
   message displays during long re-indention.  This is a new feature
   which prints percentage complete messages at specified intervals.

** Better menu titles in FSF's Emacs.

** Improved selective-display compatibility.

** Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes!

** Some performance enhancements, but nothing radically better.


* User visible changes since 3.349

** New major-mode: objc-mode for Objective-C editing. Also added,
   objc-mode-hook, objc-mode-abbrev-table, objc-mode-map, and
   objc-mode-syntax-table.

** New syntactic symbols objc-method-intro, objc-method-args, and
   objc-method-call-cont have been added, with appropriate offsets in
   c-offsets-alist.

** Ellemtel style puts substatement-open braces on their own line.

** Better conformance to GNU coding style. New line up function set on
   arglist-close for GNU style: c-lineup-arglist-intro-after-paren.

** bracket lists are treated like paren lists (i.e. they are given the
   appropriate arglist-* syntax).

** some changes to recognition of brace-lists. When an otherwise
   brace-list-entry or brace-list-intro is found to start with an open
   brace, the line is given brace-list-open syntax instead.

** brace-list-intro and brace-list-entry are hangable via
   c-hanging-braces-alist.

** c-set-offset provides a reasonable default in the prompt.

** various name changes to commands and variables for consistency of
   terminology.  The changes are:

   Cmd/Var   Old Name                       New Name
   -------   --------                       --------
   [var]     c-strict-semantics-p           c-strict-syntax-p
   [var]     c-echo-semantic-information-p  c-echo-syntactic-information-p
   [var]     c-semantics                    c-syntactic-context
   [cmd]     c-show-syntactic-information   c-show-syntactic-information

   some other, non-user-level name changes were effected as well

** Usual gobs of bug fixes.


* User-visible Changes Since 3.304

** You can now specify `hanginess' of close braces. See
   c-hanging-braces-alist.

** New syntactic symbol `substatement-open' to control indentation of
   braces which open a substatement block (i.e. if, for, ...).  C-c
   C-s used to call these ((block-open . ??) (substatement . ??)), but
   now they are just ((substatement-open . ??)).  WARNING: THIS CHANGE
   MAY AFFECT YOUR CURRENT INDENTATION SETTINGS.

** c-adaptive-block-open lineup function is removed. Obsoleted by
   substatement-open change above.

** New "Default" style returns indentation variables to their default
   values.

** Support for Lucid Emacs 19.10's mode-popup-menu convention.

** c-macro-expand command put on C-c C-e.

** New buffer-local variable c-comment-start-regexp. Useful for using
   cc-mode as a basis for other C-like languages.

** c++-mode handles try/catch blocks.  Assigns them `substatement'
   syntax similar to if/for/while/...

** c-indent-via-language-element renamed to c-indent-line for
   awk-mode, BOCM compatibility.

** Usual gobs of bug fixes.


* User-visible Changes Since 3.229

** Tons 'o performance enhancements.

** Tons 'o bug fixes.

** Improved support for nested structs in C.

** Emacs 18 support has been split out into a separate file,
   cc-mode-18.el. Emacs 18 support is a losing battle, so after this
   release, I am not going to actively maintain cc-mode for Emacs 18,
   although I will incorporate contributed patches to cc-mode-18.el.

** The last of the dependencies on c-mode.el should be removed.

** New syntactic symbol, defun-block-intro, which controls the
   indentation for the first line in a top-level function or class.

** c-indent-defun moved to C-c C-q

** c-scope-operator moved to C-c :

** New coding style added to c-style-alist: Ellemtel.  This supports
   the C++ coding style defined in "Programming in C++, Rules and
   Recommendations", Erik Nyquist and Mats Henricson, Ellemtel,
   ftp'able from euagate.eua.ericsson.se.

** c-set-style now modifies the global values by default. Buffer local
   versions are made when optional universal argument is given.

** New variable: c-inhibit-startup-warnings-p

** New custom indentation functions, which are not used by default:
   c-lineup-math and c-lineup-runin-statements.  The former lines up
   math statement-cont lines after the equals sign.  The latter lines
   up statement lines when the first statement in a block appears on
   the same line as the block opening brace.
