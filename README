README for CC Mode 5.11
Barry A. Warsaw <cc-mode-help@python.org>

Please read the cc-mode.texi manual for details on using CC Mode.

As of this writing (08-Jul-1997), CC Mode version 5 currently works
out of the box only with XEmacs 19.15 and XEmacs 20.0, and will work
with the next version of Emacs.  CC Mode will be distributed with the
next version of Emacs and XEmacs.

Emacs 19.34 is missing some stuff that CC Mode requires, but you can
make CC Mode 5 work with it by loading the file cc-mode-19.el.  See
that file for details.

Check the CC Mode web pages

    <http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/cc-details.html>

for more information.

Preformatted versions of the manual in DVI, PostScript, and Info, are
all available at <http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/>.

To build the manual yourself, you will need the latest Texinfo release
(currently Texinfo 3.9).  Specifically, you must make sure that your
are using at least version 2.185 of the texinfo.tex file.  To build
the Info manual, simply type:

    % makeinfo cc-mode.texi

To make the DVI version, simply type:

    % texi2dvi cc-mode.texi

The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you should
have gotten with this distribution.
