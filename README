NOTE: All XEmacs distributions since 19.11, and Emacs distributions
since 19.30 come with cc-mode.  As of this writing, XEmacs 19.14 and
Emacs 19.33 have both been recently released and come pre-configured
to use an older version of cc-mode so you should upgrade to this
version of cc-mode.  The texinfo manual describes how to do this.

If you are using an older XEmacs or Emacs, consider upgrading.

The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you should
have gotten with this distribution.
