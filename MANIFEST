You should have received the following files in the distribution tar
file for cc-mode 4.222:

    ANNOUNCEMENT: Release announcement as it appeared on various newsgroups.

    MANIFEST: This file.

    cc-mode.el: Version 4.222 of the mode.

    cc-mode.texi: Texinfo manual.

    cc-compat.el: Helps ease the transition from c-mode.el to cc-mode
    style indentation control.  This is provided for your convenience
    only, and is completely unguaranteed and unsupported.

    cc-mode-18.el: Emacs 18 compatibility file.  This is provided for
    your convenience only, and is completely unguaranteed and
    unsupported.  Emacs 18 support will be completely dropped in
    cc-mode version 5.

    cc-guess.el: Experiments in style guessing.  This is provided for
    your convenience only, and is completely unguaranteed and
    unsupported.

    cc-lobotomy.el: Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs.

    README: Quick intro into how to get cc-mode up and running.

    DUMPING: An guide to ditching c-mode.el and c++-mode.el in favor
    of cc-mode.el.  Probably out-of-date and unnecessary for the
    newest Emacs and XEmacs releases.

    ChangeLog: Extremely verbose history of changes.
