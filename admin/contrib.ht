<h2>Contributed Stuff</h2>

<h3>Font lock for IDL mode</h3>

Three people have contributed Emacs font-lock definitions for CORBA IDL
code.  These are useful to IDL writers since CC Mode does not contain
any font-lock definitions (for IDL, or any other supported language),
and X/Emacs itself also doesn't contain IDL font-lock definitions by
default.

<p>I'm sorry, I can't tell you which one to use.  Hopefully someday
the three alternatives will be merged and contributed to X/Emacs so
you'll just get them automatically.

<h3>Font lock for Pike mode</h3>

Like IDL mode, neither CC Mode nor X/Emacs does not come with
font-lock definitions for Pike mode.  <a href="pike.el">This
package</a> written by Per Hedbor and others provides that.
