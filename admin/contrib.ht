<h1>Contributed Stuff</a>

Three people have contributed font-lock definitions for CORBA IDL
code.  This is useful to IDL writers since CC Mode does not contain
any font-lock definitions (for IDL, or any other supported language),
and X/Emacs itself also doesn't contain IDL font-lock definitions by
default.

<p>I'm sorry, I can't tell you which one to use.  Hopefully someday
the three alternatives will be merged and contributed to X/Emacs so
you'll just get them automatically.
