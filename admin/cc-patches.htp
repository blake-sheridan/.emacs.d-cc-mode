<h1>CC Mode Patches</h1>

CC Mode version 5.11 is the first public v5 release.  There are no
patches available to get you from version 4.379 to version 5.11.  If
you are using the last beta release 5.09, then
<a href="patches/cc-mode-5.09-5.11.txt">this patch</a> will upgrade
you to version 5.11.  Be sure to run <code>make</code> after patching
to rebuild the <code>.elc</code> files.
