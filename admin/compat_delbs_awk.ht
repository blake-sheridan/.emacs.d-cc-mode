<h2><code>delbackspace.el</code> and <code>awk-mode</code></h2>

    You will encounter problems if you use either the
    <code>delbackspace</code> package or <code>awk-mode</code>, since
    neither package has been ported to CC Mode 5.  Best known
    workarounds are as follows, but since I don't use either of these
    packages, I can't completely vouch for them.

    <ul><li>If you use <code>delbackspace</code>, put the following in 
	    your <code>.emacs</code> file <em>after</em> you load
	    <code>delbackspace.el</code>, but <em>before</em> you load 
	    CC Mode:

<pre>
(setcar
 (assoc "cc-mode" after-load-alist)
 "cc-langs")
</pre>

	Note that <code>delbackspace.el</code> is obsolete as of
	XEmacs 20.3, and in fact is no longer distributed with XEmacs,
	so if you've upgraded you should just remove the delbackspace
	stuff anyway.

	<p><li>If you use <code>awk-mode</code> in older X/Emacsen, you
	    might need to make a
	    change to the source code for <code>awk-mode.el</code>
	    to look like:

<pre>
(require 'cc-mode)
(c-initialize-cc-mode)
</pre>

	    in the <code>awk-mode</code> defun.  This is fixed in
	    current versions of Emacs and XEmacs.
    </ul>
