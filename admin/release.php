  $title = "Current Release";
  include ("header.h");
?>

<p>The current release is available in several forms.  You can
download the entire source distribution, including the manual in
texinfo format as an approximately <a
href="http://download.sourceforge.net/cc-mode/cc-mode-5.28.tar.gz">160KB
gzip'd tarball</a>.  You can also download the <a
href="ftp://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/pub/cc-mode/cc-mode/">individual
files</a> of the current release.

<p>The documentation is also available in several forms.  You can
either <a href="cc-mode.html#Top">browse the on-line documentation</a>
or grab one of the several <a
href="ftp://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/pub/cc-mode/manual/">pre-formatted</a>
documents generated from the texinfo source, including PostScript,
Emacs Info, and HTML versions</a>.

<p>Since version 5.26, CC Mode supports using Filladapt mode to fill
text in comments and string literals.  There are however still some <a
href="filladapt.php">issues</a> with this that you should be aware of
if you want to use Filladapt in CC Mode.
