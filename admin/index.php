<p><strong>CC Mode is an Emacs and XEmacs mode for editing C and other
languages with similar syntax; currently C++, Objective-C, Java,
CORBA's IDL, and Pike. It's a standard package in both Emacs and
XEmacs.</strong>

<p>CC Mode is brought to you by Martin Stjernholm, the current CC Mode
maintainer.  Several people before him have helped make CC Mode what
it is today, notably Barry Warsaw who took over of BOCM (Boring Old C
Mode) back in 1992 and revamped it to CC Mode.

5.28.  A list of <a href="changes-latest.php">recent changes</a> are
