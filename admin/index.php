<p><strong>CC Mode is a GNU Emacs and XEmacs mode for editing C and other
languages with similar syntax; currently C++, Objective-C, Java, CORBA's
IDL, and Pike. It's a standard package in both GNU Emacs and
XEmacs.</strong>

<p>CC Mode is brought to you by the current CC Mode maintainer Martin
Stjernholm.  Several people before him have helped make CC Mode what
it is today, notably Barry Warsaw who took care of BOCM (Boring Old C
Mode) in 1992 and revamped it to CC Mode.
