Checklist for doing a release:

    - Run regression tests in as many Emacsen as possible.  Make sure
      there are no failures.

    - Proofread and update ANNOUNCEMENT, MANIFEST, README for the new
      release.

    - Update ChangeLog.  Since C-x v a no longer works, use the new
      Python Update.py script, which sadly still needs to be manually
      hacked.

    - Add `Release 5.xx' tag to ChangeLog.  Release script looks for
      this.
