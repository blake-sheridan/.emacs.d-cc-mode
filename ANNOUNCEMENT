Release announcement for cc-mode.el 4.85

This message is to announce the availability of cc-mode.el version
4.85.  cc-mode.el is a GNU Emacs mode for editing C (K&R and ANSI),
C++, and Objective-C code.  The last full release was of version
4.35. A list of user visible changes is outlined below.

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available both via anonymous ftp and email, the source code is not
being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further down
in this message.

If you want to become a beta tester send add requests to
cc-mode-victims-request@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.  Other mailing list
addresses are outlined in the README file.

This release was timed to coincide with a number of external events.
One is the release of XEmacs 19.11 (formerly Lucid Emacs).  XEmacs
19.11 comes with cc-mode already integrated, so XEmacs users will get
all this for free.

Note also that I am moving to a new job!  I don't yet know what the
state of the mailing lists will be, but for a short while, I expect
mail will get forwarded to my new address, so please continue to send
bug reports, add/drop messages to the old addresses.  I'll make the
appropriate announcements to the various newsgroups when I know more
what's going to happen.  My *tentative* new email address is given
above.  No guarantees that will really be it, as I don't start the job
until Sept. 19, 1994.  Don't try sending mail there at least until
after that date.

As always a huge thank you goes out to all the cc-mode-victims beta
testers!  Special thanks go to Lele Gaifax for the Objective-C mode
patches.


User visible changes since 4.35
===============================

c-set-offset and related functions and variables can now accept
variable symbols.  Also ++ and -- which mean 2* positive and negative
c-basic-offset respectively.

New variable, c-recognize-knr-p, which controls whether K&R C
contructs will be recognized.  Trying to recognize K&R constructs is a
time hog so if you're programming strictly in ANSI C, set this
variable to nil (it should already be nil in c++-mode).

New variable, c-hanging-comment-ender-p for controlling
c-fill-paragraph's behavior.

New syntactic symbol: statement-case-open.  This is assigned to lines
containing an open brace just after a case/default label.

New variable, c-progress-interval, which controls minibuffer update
message displays during long re-indention.  This is a new feature
which prints percentage complete messages at specified intervals.

Better menu titles in FSF's Emacs.

Improved selective-display compatibility.

Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes!

Some performance enhancements, but nothing radically better.


Getting cc-mode.el
===================
The latest public release version of this file should always be
available for anonymous ftp on the Emacs Lisp Archive machine.  The
path to the file is:

archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/modes/cc-mode.tar.Z

This file contains .el source, README and ancillary files.

For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC
ftpmail'er at the address ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Send the
following message in the body of your mail to that address to get
cc-mode:

reply <a valid net address back to you>
connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
binary
uuencode
chdir pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/modes
get cc-mode.tar.Z

or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.


Manifest (what you get in the tar file)
=======================================
MANIFEST: recursion

cc-mode.el: Version 4.85 of the mode.

cc-compat.el: version 1.2.  Helps ease the transition from c-mode.el
to cc-mode style indentation control.  This is provided for your
convenience only, and is completely unguaranteed and unsupported.

cc-mode-18.el: Emacs 18 compatibility file.  This is provided for your
convenience only, and is completely unguaranteed and unsupported.
Emacs 18 support will probably be completely dropped in cc-mode
version 5.

README: manual on how to use cc-mode to edit C, C++, and Objective-C
files. Eventually this will be replaced by a texinfo manual.
VOLUNTEERS ARE SOUGHT to help complete the manual.

DUMPING: A guide to ditching c-mode.el and c++-mode.el in favor of
cc-mode.el.  Unnecessary for XEmacs 19.11!  Yay!

ChangeLog: Extremely verbose history of changes.
