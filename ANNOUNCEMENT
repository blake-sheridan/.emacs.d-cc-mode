This message announces the availability of cc-mode version 4.222.
cc-mode is a GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++, and
Objective-C code.  The last full release was of version 4.85.  A list
of user visible changes is outlined below.  See the MANIFEST file for
a description of other files included in this release.

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available both via anonymous ftp and email, the source code is not
being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further down
in this message.

If you want to become a beta tester send add requests to
cc-mode-victims-request@merlin.cnri.reston.va.us.  Other mailing list
addresses are outlined in the README file.  Note that all old
addresses which refer to anthem.nlm.nih.gov are no longer valid!  They
may be forwarded to the new addreseses for some limited amount of
time.

This release was timed to coincide with a number of external events.
One of these is the release of both Emacs 19.29 from the FSF, and
XEmacs 19.12 from UIUC.  Both of these Emacsen should be released with
cc-mode already integrated.  The other external event is the movement
of the mailing list and help addresses to merlin.cnri.reston.va.us.

As always a huge thank you goes out to all the cc-mode-victims beta
testers!  Without their help and suggestions, it would have been
impossible for me to release this.  Special thanks go to Krishna
Padmasola for generating a texinfo file from the 4.85 README.  It's
because of Krishna's efforts that there is now a texinfo manual.


User visible changes since 4.85
===============================

Compatibility with outline-minor-mode added.

c-offsets-alist recognizes two new offset shortcuts: '* and '/.  These
stand for 1 times 0.5 and -0.5 respectively (rounded to the nearest
integer of course).

c-recognize-knr-p is by default nil in all modes.

Major rewrite of the style feature.  All style variables should be
buffer local now, and the default style is "GNU".  There is a
"CC-MODE" style which represents the baseline old cc-mode style.  You
may need to install this style if you use c-set-offset or setq
directly in your mode hooks.  Note that all styles implicitly derive
from "CC-MODE" so if you set your own style, you should be okay.
There is no style named "Default".

New variable c-indent-comments-syntactically-p.

New function c-add-style.  Greatly simplifies the addition of new styles.

New variables c-file-style and c-file-offset for File Local Variable
support of style setting.  May only work in Emacs 19.29 and XEmacs
19.12.

More flexibility added to c-hanging-braces-alist which allow you to
add custom ACTION functions for determining brace hanginess.

New variable c-hanging-semi&comma-criteria opens up the calculation
and insertion of newlines after commas and semicolons.

New option for c-cleanup-list: snug-do-while.

New function to optionally enable recognition of // as a comment
delimiter in c-mode.  See the function c-enable-//-in-c-mode.

C-c C-v is no longer bound to c-version.  This binding conflicted with
OOBR.  Use M-x c-version RET.

Texinfo manual!  Yay!

The usual assortment of bug fixes and performance enhancements.
