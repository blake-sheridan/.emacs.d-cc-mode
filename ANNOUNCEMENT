This message announces the availability of cc-mode version 4.241.
cc-mode is a GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++, and
Objective-C code.  The last full release was of version 4.222.  This
is primarily a bug fix release; a list of user visible changes is
outlined below.  See the MANIFEST file for a description of other
files included in this release.

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available both via anonymous ftp and email, the source code is not
being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further down
in this message.

If you want to become a beta tester send add requests to
cc-mode-victims-request@merlin.cnri.reston.va.us.  Other mailing list
addresses are outlined in the README file.  Note that all old
addresses which refer to anthem.nlm.nih.gov are no longer valid!  They
may be forwarded to the new addreseses for some limited amount of
time.  These mailing lists are maintained by the Majordomo automated
mailing list software.

As always a huge thank you goes out to all the cc-mode-victims beta
testers!  Without their help and suggestions, it would have been
impossible for me to release this.  Special thanks go to Krishna
Padmasola for generating a texinfo file from the 4.85 README.  It's
because of Krishna's efforts that there is now a texinfo manual.


User visible changes since 4.222
================================

* A better version of c-lineup-ObjC-method-call which does a better
  job of handling: 1. indentation of arguments to keyword parameters,
  2. multiline method calls.

* A better version of c-backslash-region, which does a better job of
  handling the right-align of backslashes.

* Bug fixes!

Getting cc-mode.el
===================

NOTE: THIS SECTION HAS CHANGED.

It appears as though the Emacs Lisp Archive no longer has an active
maintainer, so I am not recommending that machine as the canonical ftp
site anymore.  The last time I checked the cc-mode on that machine had
not been updated in a long time.

There is now a new canonical ftp site which you can use.  Here is the
ftp URL for the tar distribution:

	ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode.tar.gz

This is a gzip'd tar file containing the .el source code and
documentation, along with sundry other useful files.  See the MANIFEST
a complete list of the contained files.

For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC
ftpmail'er at the address ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Send the following
message in the body of your mail to that address to get cc-mode:

reply <a valid net address back to you>
connect ftp.python.org
binary
uuencode
chdir pub/emacs
get cc-mode.tar.gz

or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.
