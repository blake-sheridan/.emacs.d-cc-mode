Release announcement for cc-mode 4.322

This message announces the availability of cc-mode version 4.322.
cc-mode is a GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++,
Objective-C, and Java code.  A list of user visible changes is
outlined below.  See the MANIFEST file for a description of other
files included in this release.

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available both via anonymous ftp and email, the source code is not
being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further down
in this message.

NOTE: XEmacs 19.14 and Emacs 19.34 both contain an older version of
cc-mode, so users of these Emacsen should upgrade their cc-mode.

If you want to become a beta tester send subscribe requests to
cc-mode-victims-request@python.org.  If you just want announcements of
new versions, send subscribe requests to
cc-mode-announce-request@python.org.  These mailing lists are
maintained by the Majordomo automated mailing list software.

NOTE: Since I discovered Python, I have severely curtailed my (ab)use
of C (and derivative) languages, and since I use Grail, I haven't
started hacking Java yet! :-) So my motivation for maintaining this
mode is waning, and I'm looking for volunteers to either take over or
help out with bits and pieces.  If you're interested and have a solid
Emacs Lisp programming background, send me email at the cc-mode-help
address above.  Trust me, fame and forture are to be yours! :-)

Oh and a few shameless plugs.  For more information on Python see

User visible changes since 4.282
================================

* New style "linux" added.

* New syntactic symbols: extern-lang-open, extern-lang-close,
  inextern-lang for customizing extern language blocks.

* New syntactic analysis for inline-open braces.  These no longer have
  relative buffer positions, but such lines are now recognized as
  ((inclass . XXX) (inline-open))

* c-mark-function moved to C-c C-m

* New variable: c-insert-tab-function

* New variable: c-label-minimum-indentation for enforcing GNU
  standards (in "gnu" style only).

* New function: c-lineup-arglist-close-under-parent

* c-show-syntactic-information (C-c C-s) now takes a universal argument.

* Better performance for K&R C.  Note c-recognize-knr-p is deprecated.

* The following variables have been removed from the default "cc-mode"
  style:

    c-echo-syntactic-information-p
    c-string-syntax-p
    c-tab-always-indent
    c-inhibit-startup-warnings-p

* The usual bug fixes!
