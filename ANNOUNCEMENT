This message announces the availablity of a new version of CC Mode, a
GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++, Objective-C, Java,
CORBA's IDL, and now Pike code.  A list of user visible changes is
summarized below, and is also available from

	<http://www.python.org/emacs/cc-mode/changes-523.html>

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available via the Web, the source code is not being posted here.
Downloading instructions are provided further down in this message.

Changes since 5.21
==================

- Note: there was no net release of 5.22!  This version went only to
  the XEmacs developers and was primarily a bug fix release.

- Support for the Pike language added, along with new Pike specific
  syntactic symbols: inlambda, lambda-intro-cont

- Support for Java anonymous classes via new syntactic symbol
  inexpr-class.  New syntactic symbol inexpr-statement for Pike
  support and gcc-style statements inside expressions.  New lineup
  function c-lineup-inexpr-stat.

- New syntactic symbol brace-entry-open which is used in brace lists
  (i.e. static initializers) when a list entry starts with an open
  brace.  These used to be recognized as brace-list-entry's.
  c-electric-brace also recognizes brace-entry-open braces
  (brace-list-entry's can no longer be electrified).

- New command c-indent-line-or-region, not bound by default.

- Improvements to M-C-h (c-mark-function).

- Parentheses are now electric (via the new command c-electric-paren)
  for auto-reindenting lines when parens are typed.

- In "gnu" style, inline-open offset is now set to zero.

- Uniform handling of the inclass syntactic symbol.  The indentation
  associated with it is now always relative to the class opening
  brace.  This means that the indentation behavior has changed in some
  circumstances, but only if you've put anything besides 0 on the
  class-open syntactic symbol (none of the default styles do that).

- c-enable-xemacs-performance-kludge-p is set to nil by default, since 
  for Emacs-friendly styles (i.e. where the top-level opening brace
  starts in column zero) setting this variable to t can degrade
  performance significantly.

- The usual bug fixes.
