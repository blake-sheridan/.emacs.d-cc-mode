Release Announcement
CC Mode Version 5.30
Martin Stjernholm <mailto:bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>
Alan Mackenzie <mailto:bug-cc-mode@gnu.org> (AWK support)

This message announces the availability of a new version of CC Mode,
an Emacs and XEmacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++,
Objective-C, Java, CORBA's IDL, Pike and AWK code.

It's been a long time (too long) since the last CC Mode release, and
consequently the amount of change is large - this version has almost
twice the code size of the previous one.  Most of the new code
concerns the new advanced font lock support for all the supported
languages, and the AWK support contributed by Alan Mackenzie.

A list of user visible changes is detailed in the NEWS file and in the
URL listed below.  More information, including links to download the
source, are available on the CC Mode web page:

There is also a link to the CC Mode announcement mailing list, a
