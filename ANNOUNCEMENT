<mailto:cc-mode-help@python.org>

This message announces the availablity of a new version of CC Mode, a
GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++, Objective-C, Java
and CORBA's IDL code.  A list of user visible changes is summarized
below, and is also available from

	<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/cc-details.html>

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available via the Web, anonymous ftp, and email, the source code is
not being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further
down in this message.

If you want to get announcements of new CC Mode releases, send the
word `subscribe' in the body of a message to

	cc-mode-announce-request@python.org

Note that the cc-mode-victims mailing list was recently
decommissioned.  Send all CC Mode correspondence to

	cc-mode-help@python.org


Getting CC Mode
===============

The canonical ftp site for the full CC Mode tar distribution is:

	<ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode.tar.gz>

This is a gzip'd tar file containing the .el source code and
documentation, along with sundry other useful files.  See the MANIFEST
a complete list of the contained files.  You can get individual files
from the directory:

	<ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode/>

Find out more about CC Mode on the Web:

	<http://www.python.org/ftp/emacs/>

For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC
ftpmail'er at the address ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Send the following
message in the body of your mail to that address to get CC Mode:

reply <a valid net address back to you>
connect ftp.python.org
binary
uuencode
chdir pub/emacs
get cc-mode.tar.gz

or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.
Note that I am in no way connected with the DEC ftpmail'er so you are
own your own with this route.

Changes since 5.20
==================

- This is a bug fix release only.

Changes since 5.19
==================

- Martin Stjernholm has joined the cc-mode-help@python.org
  maintainers!

- Multiline macros are now handled, both as they affect indentation,
  and as recognized syntax.  New syntactic symbol cpp-macro-cont is
  assigned to second and subsequent lines of a multiline macro
  definition. 

- A new style "user" which captures all non-hook-ified
  (i.e. top-level) .emacs file variable setings and customizations.
  Style "cc-mode" is an alias for "user" and is deprecated.  "gnu"
  style is still the default however.

- "java" style now conforms to Sun's JDK coding style.

- New commands c-beginning-of-defun, c-end-of-defun which are not
  bound by default to C-M-a and C-M-e.

- New and improved implementations of M-a (c-beginning-of-statement)
  and M-e (c-end-of-statement).

- C++ namespace blocks are supported, with new syntactic symbols
  namespace-open, namespace-close, and innamespace.

- File local variable settings of c-file-style and c-file-offsets
  makes the style variables local to that buffer only.

- New indentation functions c-lineup-close-paren,
  c-indent-one-line-block, c-lineup-dont-change.

- Various Imenu patches (thanks to Masatake Yamato, Jan Dubois, and
  Peter Pilgrim).

- Performance improvements.  Some improvements affect only Emacs or
  only XEmacs (see the variable c-enable-xemacs-performance-kludge-p).

- Improvements (hopefully!) to the way CC Mode is loaded.  You should
  now be able to do a (require 'cc-mode) to get the entire package
  loaded properly for customization in your .emacs file.  A new
  variable c-initialize-on-load controls this and is set to t by
  default.

- Usual assortment of bug fixes.
